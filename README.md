# rfairley.github.io

This is my personal website to summarize my experience, and practice
front-end development.

This theme includes:
- flexboxes to let content span the page width with a changing window size
- parallax effect of cover image and background textures

## Maintenance

### Re-download jQuery library:

```sh
./download_jquery.sh
```
