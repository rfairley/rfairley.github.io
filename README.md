This serves as a personal website to consolidate my experience and any projects I am working on - and also for me to practice web development. I improved the theme from my previous website, which looked a lot older and had some issues with the scripting behind it. 

With this version of the theme I was able to apply CSS knowledge of flexible boxes which span the width of the page and respond well to changes in window sze, and also of effects such as overlay textures. The parallax effect (moving backgrounds faster than page scrolling) of the cover image and the background textures was achieved through JavaScript, by querying the current scroll position from the top and setting positions accordingly. Overall, I believe this is a good balance of visual effects without trying to get too complicated.
